# create-story README

## Features

This VSCode extension can help you generate a starter storybook file for your React JSX files. Currently, it works only with pure React functional components. It also accepts default props from the file when defined and adds them to generated storybook file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[react-file\]\(images/react-file.png\)
\!\[context-menu\]\(images/context-menu.png\)
\!\[command-palette\]\(images/command-palette.png\)
\!\[generated-story\]\(images/generated-story.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
